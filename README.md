# Helium API Examples #

[Helium](https://helium.com) is an integrated platform of smart
sensors, communication, edge and cloud compute that makes building IoT
applications easy.

The Helium API examples show how to use both the REST APIs to access
data from the [Helium cloud](https://dev.helium.com/cloud-api/v1/getting-started/)
as well as script examples and sensor libraries showing how to
use [helium-script](https://dev.helium.com/guides/helium-script/) to
configure and use a number of physical sensors.
